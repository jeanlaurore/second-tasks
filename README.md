RISK INSIGHTS - The Big Freeze and the resulting Water damage.
 
REPLACE TEXT WITH EDIT - When freezing temperatures arrive, the water damage claims begin to flow at the first thaw.
It is time to make sure of the following:
 
1. Make sure your policy has total coverage for Water Damage.
2. Understand where in the policy the coverage is afforded as it makes a significant difference in deductibles, I.e., if the range is afforded under the definition of the flood rather than all risk perils, the deductible can be multiples of your all peril policy deductible.
3. If covered under flood peril, asked to have this cover put under standard all perils qualifying any water damage for lower retention and better coverage.
 
Lastly, on any water damage loss, never sign off on a loss until many weekly or you get to sign off from a professional. Water damage often manifests itself many weeks or months later, particularly if water touches any electrical items or porous material.
 
RISK INSIGHTS - The new NYC Experience Modification Rating
 
REPLACE TEXT WITH EDIT - We wanted to make you aware of the above reference. The NY Compensation Insurance Rating Board will now provide a standalone NY experience modification rating similar to NJ, CA, PA, DE, and MI. 
The new methodology "EMR" will change and will include the following in its formula:
 
· A new simplified formula
 
· Variable primary/excess split points
 
· A new EMR capping/maximum debit mod procedure based on the number of claims
 
· Discontinuance of the merit rating plan; all NY risks with experience during the experience rating period will be experience-rated
 
The new modification methodology will take effect on October 1, 2022, and as the formulas have not been made explicit, the specific change from your current modification is not known at this time; however, we believe that it would be similar. The NYCIRB has stated that the maximum that any modification can be increased will be capped at 30% regardless of the new methodology used.
 
 
We will, of course, be seeking updates as to the exact formulas that will be used so that any significant changes can be notified to you for budget purposes. Still, once again, our anticipation is that if the majority of your payroll is NY impact should not be significant; however, if multi-state payroll is involved, depending on where the claims occur, it can have an impact on the other states, which may or may not be total change dramatically the overall cost of the program but will need to be looked at closely. We will be communicating on this as more information becomes available and providing advice as to impact as near as possible with the information we received.
 
RISK INSIGHTS - Why The Internal Audit Is Important? (REMOVE SPACE BETWEEN ?)
 
REPLACE TEXT WITH EDIT - When it comes to adding value throughout an organization, there is no better source than internal auditing. Internal auditing is an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations.
 
The mission of Internal Audit is to enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice, and insight.
 
The inclusive but not an exhaustive list of value that internal auditing brings can be grouped into several categories as mentioned below:
 
1. The Business
Demonstrate a deep understanding of the organization, its history, its mission, key stakeholders, strategy, competition, corporate culture, structure, and business function.
 
2. Technology
Understand and apply those new technologies that reshape how we work and live. For e.g., blockchain, digital transformation, drones, financial technology, artificial intelligence, etc.
 
3. Governance
Testing the same risks and controls by multiple assurance providers is efficient and creates fatigue for process owners.
 
4. Risk Effort
Assess the organization's ability to foresee and respond to global events and provide advice regarding risks and opportunities.
 
5. Fieldwork
Develop audit findings using the format: Condition, Criteria, Cause, Effect, and Recommendation.
 
An internal Audit will provide a clear picture to cover all the significant potential risks after assessing all internal and external factors and providing objective opinions, information, support, and education to the top management.
